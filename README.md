#Testing-a-Continuous-Moderator

Excel spreadsheet to test a continuous moderator in meta-analysis

This spreadsheet requires that you first perform a weighted regression analysis predicting the effect size from the moderator. The resulting test of the moderator is inaccurate but parts of the output can be used to perform a valid test. Using  the reported regression coefficient for the moderator, the reported (incorrect) standard error of the regression coefficient, and the reported Mean Square Error, the spreadsheet computes the correct standard error of the coefficient and tests whether it is significantly different from 0.
